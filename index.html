		<h2> <i>Our Little History </i></h2>

	<section>
		<p>
		Durham House of Pets was founded by Maria Cherries in 2003. 
As soon as Cherries graduated from the University of New
 Hampshire with a degree in Animal Care, she decided to turn 
her savings into a business providing quality goods for the pets 
we love. Attending the university, she noticed the number students 
living with their pets on campus have limited access to animal 
products. The number of service animals, Health and Wellness 
Program from UNH brings in during testing season are limited to pet 
supplies such as dog food. Students and staff members will have 
to drive miles in order to purchase these supplies. 
Some students do not have the necessities to do so, 
thus Cherries bought pet supplies to the residents of Durham, NH. Now, our
headquarter is in New York, New York with another regional branch in Manchester, NH! </p>

	<p>Here at Durham House of Pets, we offer a variety of 
products that are fun, secure, user-friendly, and safe. 
Our products are always developing and the store has 
expanded since 2003. We have grown from just selling pet 
food to appeal, toys and so much more! </p>

	<p> We believe in providing our customers with the best of the
 best and is always looking for ways to improve. We work closely
 with the university and their research programs to find new 
ways to build our toys selection and the nutrition 
department to serve pets the healthiest foods. The majority of 
our staff members are students that are officiated with the school
 that specializes in animal care. </p>
